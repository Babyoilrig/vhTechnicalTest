## Dosage Calculator
ACME Pharmaceutical LTD require a dosage calculator tool that will provide support and guidance to healthcare professionals (HCP) on how to achieve the intended daily dose of their new drug Galanpirox.

Galanpirox comes in two tablet sizes: 75mg and 150mg and must be taken for a period of 7 to 14 days.

The HCP will select the intended daily dose and over how many days they would like Galanpirox to be taken.

The calculator must calculate the most efficient daily dose of the tablet sizes available.

The total prescription is the total amount of Galanpirox taken over the specified time period.

The prescription total is the total number of Galanpirox tablets for each size over the specified time period.

The daily dose is the total number of Galanpirox tablets for each size for 1 day.

### Example

A daily dose of 375mg for 8 days should calculate the following values:

**Total prescription:** 3000mg

**Prescription total:** 16 x 150mg, 8 x 75mg

**Daily dose:** 2 x 150mg, 1 x 75mg
